Choas and iterations
REF : Mathematics : From the birth of numbers, Jan Gullberg, p348
(...)
Non linear fun (1 - cx^2) applied to itself n times with -1 < x_0 < 1

There is stable point up to c = 3/4
Then there is the first bifurcation
Then one more,
Then it become chaos!

## Usage

go get gonum.org/v1/plot/...
go build ./chaos.go
./chaos
