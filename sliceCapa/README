In go, it seems that one can not directly address indexes beyond the slice's
length even if its capacity would permit it. The idea would be to put some
element beyond the slice's length limit and somehow keep them behind the scene
if we don't need them.

This code is a simple example to put a element after the permitted index, but
still keep the same length. There are probably other ways to achieve the same
thing, but that's an example
